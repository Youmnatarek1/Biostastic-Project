Post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) is a globally significant disease in pig production, primarily caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and commonly controlled with antimicrobials. Alternative strategies, including dietary fiber and zinc oxide (ZnO), have shown beneficial effects; however, the use of ZnO may be discontinued by 2022. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of vaccination compared to the addition of ZnO and nutraceuticals in pig feed for controlling PWD.
